# plmc
plmc infers [undirected graphical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_random_field) to describe coevolution and covariation in families of biological sequences. With a multiple sequence alignment as an input, plmc can quantify inferred coupling strengths between all pairs of positions (couplingsfile output) or infer a generative model of the sequences for predicting the effects of mutations or designing new sequences (paramfile output).

## Compilation
plmc requires no external libraries, but can optionally be accelerated with OpenMP for multicore parallelism.

**Multicore**. To compile with `gcc` and OpenMP: 

    make all-openmp

On macOS, OpenMP requires that an external version of GCC be installed rather than `clang`. Precompiled binaries of GCC are available [here](http://hpc.sourceforge.net/) or can be downloaded through package managers like homebrew or macports.

**Single core, Linux**. To compile with `gcc`: 

    make all

**Single core, Mac OS X**. To compile with `clang`:

    make all-mac

**Single precision**. All of the above targets compile to double precision (64 bit), but reducing the precision to single (32 bit) increases speed and decreases memory requirements by approximately a factor of two. The fastest compile settings are then:

    make all-openmp32

## Output

**Coupling scores**. The `couplingsfile` is a flat text file containing scores quantifying the inferred strength of the coupling between every pair of positions. It has 6 columns: `RES_I FOCUS_AI RES_J FOCUS_AJ 0 SCORE`, where `SCORE` is the coupling score between positions `RES_I` and `RES_J`, `FOCUS_AI` and `FOCUS_AJ` are the letters in the focus sequence (optional, `-` if no focus), `0` is a placeholder. The `SCORE` values are APC-corrected Frobenius norm scores, but alternative scores can be computed from the raw parameter values.

**Parameter estimates**. The optional `paramfile` specified with `-o`, will store all inferred model parameters in binary. These can get large, as for proteins the model explicitly parameterizes all possible pairs of amino acids at all possible pairs of postions, which is about 10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>8</sup> numbers for families of lengths ~70-700.  The MATLAB script `scripts/read_params.m` unpacks this binary file into model parameters as well as associated metadata, such as inferred sequence weights.

**Sequence weights**. The optional `weightsfile` specified with `--save-weights` (and loaded with `-w`) is a flat text file containing one floating-point weight per line. Each sequence's weight is the inverse of the number of neighboring sequences with less than θ percent divergence.

## Examples
**Protein alignments**. The example directory includes an alignment of the protein [dihdyrofolate reductase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrofolate_reductase) (DHFR). To infer a model for this family, we can type the following in the base directory:

    bin/plmc -o example/protein/DHFR.params -le 16.0 -lh 0.01 -m 100 -g -f DYR_ECOLI example/protein/DHFR.a2m
The numeric options set a strong L2 regularization for the couplings, λ<sub>e</sub> = 16.0, a weak L2 regularization for the sites, λ<sub>h</sub> = 0.01, and the maximum number of iterations at 100. The focus `-f` option tells plmc to only model columns that are upper-case in the E. coli sequence DYR_ECOLI (NOTE: for focus mode, the alignment should only contain columns that are coding in the focus sequence, otherwise the offsets for the output sequence will be incorrect.) The  `-g` gap-ignoring option ignores gaps by modeling only the coding portions of each sequence. To read the binary paramfile `DHFR.eij` and visualize the couplings, we can type the following in MATLAB from the `scripts` directory:

    params = read_params('../example/protein/DHFR.params');
    plot_coupling_scores(params)

This computes and plots the same (APC-corrected) coupling strengths that would be output to couplingfile, revealing many strongly coupled pairs of positions in the long-term evolution of DHFR:

Each coupling strength summarizes a larger set of coupling parameters, since the model explicitly parameterizes each possible combination of amino acids at each pair of positions. To visualize these sequence-level parameters, we can use a JavaScript tool [EVzoom](https://github.com/debbiemarkslab/EVzoom) that is designed to visualize plmc models. For efficiency, we export only the strongly coupled pairs (culled by an EM-based outlier-detection method) in a lightweight JSON format with

      export_couplings_json(read_params('../example/protein/DHFR.params'), '../example/protein/DHFR.json')

[EVzoom](https://github.com/debbiemarkslab/EVzoom) makes it possible to navigate the large number of sequence-level parameters present in undirected models of sequence families:

**RNA alignments**. 
 An example RNA alignment is included for the [SAM riboswitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAM_riboswitch_(S_box_leader)). To infer the couplings with an RNA alphabet (.ACGU) type the following in the base directory:

    bin/plmc -c example/RNA/RF00162.EC -o example/RNA/RF00162.params -a .ACGU -le 20.0 -lh 0.01 -m 50 example/RNA/RF00162.fasta

To plot the aggregated coupling scores type the following in MATLAB from the `scripts` directory:

    params = read_params('../example/RNA/RF00162.params');
    plot_coupling_scores(params)
<p align="center"><img src="example/RNA/RF00162.png" width="500"></p>

The default alphabet (-ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY) can be overridden by the option `-a ALPHABET`. All uppercase letters and non-letter ASCII characters are acceptable. Lowercase letters in the alignment file will be mapped to the corresponding uppercase letter, except for in focus mode `-f`, in which columns that are lower case in the focus sequence will be discarded.

**Physical systems**. As an example, simulated draws from a 3-state, 1-dimensional Potts model are provided in the examples folder and encoded by the characters _, *, and ^. The following command would estimate the parameters by running to convergence with λ<sub>e</sub> = 1.0, λ<sub>h</sub> = 1.0 and sequence reweighting disabled:

    bin/plmc -c example/potts/potts3.txt -a _*^ -t -1 -le 1.0 -lh 1.0 example/potts/potts3.a2m
A 1D Potts model will only have interactions between i -> i + 1, which should be evident in the coupling summary scores output to example/potts/potts3.txt
